# Semantics of Programming Languages

This course is intended to introduce the structural, operational approach to programming language semantics. It teaches how to specify the meaning of typical programming language constructs, in the context of language design, and how to reason formally about semantic properties of programs.

This directory contains interpreters for a series of increasingly complex languages:
- **language1**: This language is a very basic implementation of several programming constructs, introducing basic concepts such as flow control.
